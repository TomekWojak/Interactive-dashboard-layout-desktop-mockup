üí≥ FinanceApp Mockup<br><br>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is not a real finance app.


This is an **interactive mockup** built for portfolio purposes.



After entering the website, you will see a login panel (as shown in the image below). You will need to enter your username and password.

Data:<br>
Username:#j5e_dk1
<br>
Password: 123g45Z6789!
<br>
You can also access this data by clicking 'Forgot password?'

The application simulates: 
- notifications, randomly generated charts on refresh,
- UI interactions (Pro subscribtion, progress circle, task completion, etc.).

The application will simulate (*in the future*)
- login (frontend only),
- subscription plan selection (mock flow, no backend),
- user status changes (e.g., `Free` ‚Üí `Pro User`),
- ability to add transactions,
- kind of search engine


For now I only made a version for laptops. I am gradually adding functionality, if I can make it into something like a primitive finance app - I will also make a mobile version.
